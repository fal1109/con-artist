# con-artist
my personal post install script for arch. it has a modification of dhanesh's hyprland and hyyaoe/zennities hyprlock dotfiles. 

## warning 
i have not tested it yet. please execute the script at caution. i will not be responsible for janky packages, bloatware in your system and cats appearing from your cpu fan.

## instructions
 this is like a ground up thing, like your wifi isnt set up that kind of ground up.

 
1. set your wifi
2. get git
        
        pacman -S git
    
3. clone the repo
        
        git clone https://github.com/fal1109/con-artist    
4. go to the file
    
        cd con-artist
    
5. run the script
    
        sh install.sh
